## Steps to bake the perfect Donut
### Ingredients
- A granular synth for sprinkles
- An intelligent panner with 3D capabilities.
- Tons of filters with high resonance.
- Cool visuals.

### Notes
- Put frequency in control of more than just pitch (filter params, grainy stuff, delay, reverb...)
- Grain sequencer (grains can be re-pitched and played on a grid)
- Voice sequencer (create N different voices and sequence through them)
